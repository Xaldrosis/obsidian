## Download

Go to https://www.sophos.com/en-us/free-tools/sophos-xg-firewall-home-edition/software and download the free version of Sophos. Once you have signed up you will receive an e-mail with a serial number for your free firewall.

## Create VM

The VM can only have up to 4 cores and 6GB of memory. These are the limitations of the free home edition.

You will need 1 network adapter per interface / vlan. You will not be able to perform VLAN tagging inside of the VM. As a default you will need 2 network adapters to be able to install Sophos. The first network adapter will be interface LAN and the second network adapter will be interface WAN.
