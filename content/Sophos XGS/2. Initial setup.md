## Basic Configuration

We will now go through the basic settings you should perform after initializing a new firewall.

### Default CA

### Firewall Rules

Delete all the default firewall rules and create a temporary allow all and drop all firewall rule.

Go to Rules and policies -> Firewall rules.

![](sophos_setup_16.png)

Now select Add firewall rule -> New firewall rule.

As this is a temp allow all rule we will keep it simple with no scanning and only logging as no other features have been configured yet.
