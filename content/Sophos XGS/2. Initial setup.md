## Initializing and registering the firewall

Go to the default web page https://172.16.16.16:4444

Accept the terms of use.

![](sophos_setup_1.png)

Enter your new password for the "admin" user.

![](sophos_setup_2.png)

Enter a secure storage master key. Make sure to document this key properly.

![](sophos_setup_3.png)

Set the FQDN for the firewall and timezone.

![](sophos_setup_4.png)

Enter the serial number you have received from sophos over email.

![](sophos_setup_5.png)

Opt out of the customer experience improvement program and skip to finish.

![](sophos_setup_6.png)

The firewall will now apply the basic configuration and restart.

Once you login you will be greeted by a popup about Sophos Central.
Click on "Get Started" to register your firewall in Sophos Central.

![](sophos_setup_7.png)

Click on "Register".

If you do not have a Sophos Central account yet, you can create one. Otherwise you may log in.
Do note that this registration for home use differs from enterprise use.

![](sophos_setup_9.png)

Enable the Sophos Central Services.

Log into Sophos Central and accept the firewall.

## Basic Configuration

We will now go through the basic settings you should perform after initializing a new firewall.

### Default CA

Go to Certificates -> Certificate authorities and edit the default CA.

![](sophos_setup_13.png)

Fill in the details and make sure to document the private key. 

![](sophos_setup_14.png)

Now go the the "Certificates" tab and regenerate the "ApplianceCertificate".

### Firewall Rules

Delete all the default firewall rules and create a temporary allow all and drop all firewall rule.

Go to Rules and policies -> Firewall rules.

![](sophos_setup_16.png)

Now select Add firewall rule -> New firewall rule.

![](sophos_setup_17.png)

As this is a temp allow all rule we will keep it simple with no scanning and only logging as no other features have been configured yet.

![](sophos_setup_18.png)

Even though the drop all rule exists, it does not log any dropped traffic. So we will create a new drop all rule with logging enabled.

![](sophos_setup_19.png)

### NAT rules

Per default the firewall will NAT all traffic between networks. As we do not want to NAT traffic between private networks, we will create a new NAT rule.

Go to Rules and policies -> NAT rules.

Select Add NAT rule -> New NAT rule.

![](sophos_setup_20.png)

Under source we will add a new source.

![](sophos_setup_21.png)

You will add 3 networks using the following template below.

10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16

![](sophos_setup_22.png)

Once these are created you can reuse them for the original destination. Leave all other settings on default. Make sure the rule position is set to "Top".

![](sophos_setup_23.png)

### IPS

Go to Intrusion prevention -> IPS policies and enable IPS Protection.

![](sophos_setup_24.png)

### Wireless

Sophos comes with a bunch of wireless settings by default that we do not not need.

Go to Wireless -> Wireless networks and delete all wireless networks.

Go to Wireless -> Access point groups and delete the default group.

Go to Wireless -> Hotspot voucher definitions and delete the vouchers.

Go to Wireless -> Wireless settings and disable wireless protection. Do not forget to click apply in the bottom left.

### Email

Change the default hostname for the SMTP feature in Sophos. Not doing so will make your IP end up on a blacklist if you decide to use any of the emailing features within Sophos. Make sure the FQDN provided resolves to a public IP.

Go to Email -> General settings. Change the hostname and click apply on the bottom left of the page below "POP and IMAP TLS configuration"

![](sophos_setup_25.png)

### Logging

Enable all logging locally and in Sophos Central.

Go to System services -> Log settings.

![](sophos_setup_26.png)

### Default ports

Go to Administration -> Admin and user settings.

Change the default "User portal HTTPS port" to 4445 and the "VPN portal HTTPS port" to 4443.

![](sophos_setup_27.png)

### Time

Go to Administration -> Time and select "Use pre-defined NTP Server".
Click on Apply at the bottom left of the page.

![](sophos_setup_28.png)

### Pattern updates

Go to Backup & firmware -> Pattern updates and change the interval from 2 hours to 15 minutes.
