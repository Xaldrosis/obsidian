After adding these changes, the server consumes 28W on idle instead of 48W.

Make sure all the C-States features are enabled in the motherboard and set the lowest possible state to C10 instead of auto.

Go to your proxmox shell and install powertop

```
apt install powertop
```

Now let powertop auto-tune your powersaving settings.

```
powertop --auto-tune
```

These settings do not persist after a reboot so we will have to create a service to perform this command on startup.

```
nano /etc/systemd/system/powertop.service
```

Now enter the following text.

```
[Unit]
Description=PowerTOP auto-tuning


[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/powertop --auto-tune


[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Now hit ctrl + X, followed by Y and enter

Now enable the service.

```
systemctl enable powertop.service
```

To change the cpu scaling governor to powersave run the following command.

```
echo "powersave" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

Just as powertop this also does not persist after a reboot.

Open crontab.

```
crontab -e
```

Select nano as your editor in case you have to choose one.
At the bottom of the file add:

```
@reboot echo "powersave" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

Now hit ctrl + X, followed by Y and enter
