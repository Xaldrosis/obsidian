After installing proxmox we will have to change some settings.

## Update repository

After installing proxmox the default update repository will be set to the enterprise repository.
As this is a simple homelab we will disable this repository and add the free one.

Select both the enterprise repositories and select disable.

Now select Add, click ok on the subcription warning and add the "No-Subscription" repository
