Run the command to check if the SATA controller is in its own IOMMU group:

```
ls -al /sys/block/sd*
```

In case the ID ends in anything other than .0 the IMMOU group is shared. To solved this you need to install the card in the CPU PCI-E slot. Cheap consumer motherboards have all chipset PCI-E slots shared.

Using the following command you can see the main device.

```
#!/bin/bash
for d in $(find /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/ -type l | sort -n -k5 -t/); do 
    n=${d#*/iommu_groups/*}; n=${n%%/*}
    printf 'IOMMU Group %s ' "$n"
    lspci -nns "${d##*/}"
done;
```

After switching the device to the correct PCI-E slot, it now shows correctly.

Now we have to enable IOMMU.

```
nano /etc/kernel/cmdline
```

add intel_iommu=on at the end of the first line. If you have an AMD cpu, replace intel by AMD.

Save the file by hitting CTRL + X, Y and enter.

Open the modules file and add the following modules to the bottom of the file.

```
nano /etc/modules
```

```
vfio
vfio_iommu_type1
vfio_pci
vfio_virqfd
```

Save the file by hitting CTRL + X, Y and enter.

Run the following commands to apply the settings.

```
proxmox-boot-tool refresh
update-initramfs -u -k all
```

Now restart your system. 

In order to passthrough your PCI devices, you must create UEFI based VMs.
Memory ballooning must be disabled as well.
